# Fake-News-Detection

## Purpose
In this short code , I'll explain several ways to detect fake news using collected data from different articles. But the same techniques can be applied to different scenarios. For the coders and experts, I'll explain the Python code to load, clean, and analyze data. Then we will do some machine learning models to perform a classification task (fake or not).
## DataSet
The data comes from Kaggle

About the Dataset:
1. id: unique id for a news article
2. title: the title of a news article
3. author: author of the news article
4. text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
5. label: a label that marks whether the news article is real or fake:

    1: Fake news  
    
    0: real News
    
## Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression

## Libraries Used

pandas

numpy

sklean

nltk
